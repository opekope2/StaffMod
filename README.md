Adds staff from Animation vs Minecraft shorts.

## Roadmap

Functionality will be added gradually.
This will bring (hopefully) many smaller updates before a big update, so you can enjoy new (experimental) functionality, even when I don't have much time for development.
Please note that the development cycle may be slow, because I'm working on a quite big update for [OptiGUI](https://github.com/opekope2/optigui), my other mod, and I'm also in university.

### Phase 0 (done)

* Add staff item
* Add basic functionality
* Alpha release

### Phase 1 (in development)

* Add block functionalities inside staff item (a bunch of simple use blocks)
* Beta releases

### Phase 2

* Survival mode support and balancing (head over to GitHub to discuss/suggest functionality)
* Advanced block functionalities inside staff item
* Fix rendering, models, and textures
* Add server-side configuration support
* First stable release (big update)

### Phase 3

* Maybe add staff add/remove animations
* Add the rest of the blocks seen in AvM Shorts ep 33
* Everything else
