## Supported items in the staff

### Anvil, chipped anvil, damaged anvil

* **Attack Damage**: 40 (❤️×20)
* **Attack Speed**: 0.25
* **Movement Speed**: -100% (also applies, if held in off hand)

When attacking an entity, the anvil has a 12% chance of being damaged. On each attack, the staff plays the [`anvil landed`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil#Unique) sound.

!!! experiment "Heads up"
    More features are planned for anvils, like instabreaking some blocks, while unable to breaking every other block, or reducing jumping strength.

    A staff with wool block can't be used to place wool or carpet on existing wool blocks or carpets. This is by design.
