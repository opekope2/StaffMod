## Supported items in the staff

### Anvil, chipped anvil, damaged anvil

* **Attack Damage**: 40 (‚ù§Ô∏è√ó20)
* **Attack Speed**: 0.25
* **Movement Speed**: -100% (also applies, if held in off hand)

When attacking an entity, the anvil has a 12% chance of being damaged. On each attack, the staff plays the [`anvil landed`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil#Unique) sound.

!!! experiment "Heads up"
    More features are planned for anvils, like instabreaking some blocks, while unable to breaking every other block, or reducing jumping strength.

### Bell

* **Attack Damage**: 8 (‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è)
* **Attack Speed**: 1.5

* **Attack entity**: Vanilla attack behavior + rings the bell
* **Right click**: Rings the bell. Please note that as of now, this doesn't send villagers home, and doesn't make raiders glow, the bell just plays an audible noise.

!!! experiment "Heads up"
    More features are planned for bell, like the features a vanilla bell block has.

### Bone block

* **Right click**: Fertilizes the crop or ground the same way a bone meal does.

### Furnace, blast furnace, smoker

* **Attack Damage**: 5 (‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíî)
* **Attack Speed**: 2

* **Right click (hold)**: Ignites the furnace, and start a timer called `BurnTime`. This timer will increase by 1 each game tick.  
  Each game tick, the furnace tries to smelt the closest item 1.75 blocks in front of the player (¬±0.5 blocks in each axis).
  The smelting will only be successful, if the item can be smelted in the given furnace, and its count doesn't exceed `BurnTime`.
  If the smelting is successful, the whole stack will be smelted, XP will be dropped according to the vanilla furnace algorithm, and
  `BurnTime` will be decreased by the amount of items smelted.  
  If right click is released, `BurnTime` will be reset.

!!! experiment "Heads up"
    If you have suggestions about furnaces, [join the discussion here](https://github.com/opekope2/StaffMod/discussions/14).

### Lightning rod

* **Right click**: Right click on a block to summon a lightning bolt during thunder. The block (specifically, the block neighboring it
  on the cicked side) needs to have sky light level 15 (just like vanila lightning rod) to summon the lightning.

!!! experiment "Heads up"
    There are more features of the lightning bolt, like sending villagers to their houses, or making raiders glow.
    If you have suggestions about lightning rod, [join the discussion here](https://github.com/opekope2/StaffMod/discussions/23).

* **Right click (hold)**: Starts shooting fireballs every other game tick.
